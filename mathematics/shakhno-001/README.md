# Compendium of Problems in Elementary Mathematics of Increased Difficulty

**Author:** Konstantin Ustinovich Shakhno  
**Publication Year:** 1969

## Overview

This section is dedicated to the classic compendium by K. U. Shakhno, a collection of challenging problems in elementary mathematics that has inspired generations of students, educators, and competition enthusiasts. The book is renowned for presenting a wide range of problems spanning algebra, trigonometry and geometry -- that progressively increase in difficulty, pushing readers to think creatively and rigorously.

More than just a problem book, it also delivered a great deal of fun. It was one of the math problem books my parents learned from, and they passed it down to me during my school years. I fondly remember those warm evenings when we would select several problems from different categories and race to solve them. Working through these challenges is like embarking on an exciting journey of discovery, where each problem offers both a mental workout and a playful exploration of mathematics.

## Historical Context
